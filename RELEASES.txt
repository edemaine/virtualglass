***** Revision r1156 *****

-Add -nogpu (and -gpu) command-line options, to set initial state of GPU transparency menu option.

***** Revision r1153 *****

-Several command-line options have been added beyond the existing -fullscreen: -randomcomplexpiece and -randomcomplexcane start things off with random examples (as in the Examples menu); -autosave <dir> automatically saves every 10 seconds to the specified directory; -file <file> opens the specified file; -cc <email> adds additional carbon copies to emails generated from the Email button; -museum turns on touchscreen "museum" mode (warning: does not prompt you to save).

-Random complex examples now have random twist.

***** Revision r1132 *****

-Several keyboard bindings have been added to manipulating custom cane layouts and piece shapes. For instance, delete now deletes the current selection.

-Various bug fixes.


***** Revision r1118 *****

-Undo/redo behavior has changed. The old "local" undo/redo operated on the color, cane, or piece currently being edited has been changed to new "global" undo/redo that follows the sequence of operations performed on all objects, regardless of the object currently being edited. This is more consistent with similar features in other software.

-Various bug fixes.


***** Revision r1061 *****

-Undo/redo functionality has been added! This functionality saves all your changes to every color, cane, and piece, so mistakes can be easily undone and exploration of new designs is risk-free.

-The toolbar has been removed. Copying and deletion of colors, canes, and pieces can now be performed by clicking on a library object's "+" and "-". File operations such as "New File", "Open File", and "Save File" have been relegated to the File Menu.

-Various bug fixes.


***** Revision r1022 *****

-A new toolbar along the library gives quick access to common operations.
-Emailing your creations from inside VirtualGlass is now possible using the Email button in the toolbar. The recipient receives an image of your cane or piece along with the .glass file, allowing them to modify and use your designs on their computer.

-Various bug fixes. 


***** Revision r952 *****

-Save and load is here! Options in the "File" menu allow saving your glass library or individual objects to glass files (*.glass), as well as load and edit saved glass files. Files are saved in a well-known, human-readable format (JSON) allowing programmatic editing of the files.

-Piece customization is here! Select the "Customize" tab in the piece editor to edit the silhouette of your piece, allowing a wide range of exotic forms. The spline-based representation yields pieces with smooth curves, while still allowing precise control over the silhouette. Piece rendering is also improved as a side-effect of this change.

-The new "Examples" menu has a number of options for random generation of canes and pieces, useful for exploring the design space and brainstorming.

-The new "Performance" menu allows users with machines lacking a discrete graphics card (GPU) to turn off intensive GPU transparency rendering, offering higher frame rates on these machines.

-Multi-threading is now present in all three-dimensional views within VirtualGlass. This allows high-resolution views of canes and pieces without freezing or stuttering when manipulating objects in the editor. It also allows rendering in higher resolution than previously possible, improving the look of objects in all three-dimensional views.


***** Revision r732 *****

-Fill rules have been reimplemented with a simple interface: drag and drop to fill one subcane, hold shift while dragging to fill all.

-Overlay and underlay colors in the pickup editor are now only displayed within the visualization: drag a color object onto the pickup to color the underlay, hold shift while dragging to color the casing. 

-Resizing of subcanes in the cane editor is now done via a visible innermost casing that can be dragged and filled like any other casing. The resizing also works with custom cane layouts.

-Various bug fixes in the custom cane editor and casing/underlay colors in the pickup editor. 


***** Revision r723 *****

-Cane layout customization is here! The cane editor now has two modes: Standard and Customize. The Customize mode allows for freeform placement and resizing of subcanes and addition of new subcanes to allow totally custom cane layouts.

-An entirely murrine pickup layout has been added, and the rendering of murrine cane has been improved.

-Subcanes in the cane and pickup editors can now be dragged to other subcane locations, just like library objects.

-Automatic updating of library icons has been added. Upon modifying a color or cane, all objects using it immediately have their library and drag icons updated.

-Various bug fixes related to cane casing drag-resizing and rendering in cane editor.


***** Revision r694 *****

-Canes can now be twisted in both directions: clockwise and counterclockwise.

-Fixed various bugs in the cane editor and drag icons for library objects.


***** Revision r690 *****

-The application window is now completely resizable to accomodate screen resolutions large and small, wide and narrow.

-Fill rules have been reduced to `Single', `Group', and `All'. The rules `Every other' and `Every third' have been removed.


***** Revision r680 *****

First release! Some more advanced features include:

-Drag and drop of color and canes from the library into the editor.

-The ability to place multiple subcanes at one once using ``Fill rule''
options in the cane and piece editors.

-Customizable cane casings, including addition or removal of canes, 
adjustable thickness by dragging the casing, circular ad square shapes,
and coloring by dragging library colors into the editor.

-Customizable pickup casing and underlay colors. Drag and drop color 
into the color swatch to change.
