This is a VirtualGlass file containing a saved set of colors, canes, and pieces.

Editing attributes by hand is possible, and reading/editing these files 
programmatically is possible using a Json library, e.g. JsonCpp.

The dependancies among objects (e.g. a cane using a color) are described by
a set of pointer fields in canes, pickups, pieces (e.g. ''Color pointer'',
''Cane pointer'') and numeric object IDs (e.g. 9 in ''Color_9'', 
5 in ''Cane_5'') in object names.

A reserved set of color and cane IDs, specifically ''Color_0'', ''Cane_0'', 
and ''Cane_1'' are reserved for global default glass objects and should not
be used in any .glass file.
