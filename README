1. Getting your bearings.

The project uses QT (http://qt.nokia.com/products/) version 4.7.3, 
which is was the current version as of April 2011. QT is simply
a framework for cross-platform desktop applications, and it has
windows, dialog boxes, buttons, event handling, etc.

Part of QT is qmake and project files (.pro files). Like configure
and other meta-Makefile programs. If you're using QTCreator, the IDE
for creating QT apps, then the project file is what you point QTCreator to
so that it knows what files to compile, special libraries it needs
(OpenGL in our case), etc. 

If you're not using QTCreator (Andrew: I have not as of 5/12/11), then
to compile your project you need the project file to feed to qmake , 
which then creates a normal makefile for compilation. For example, on
Mac OS X, starting with a fresh SVN checkout, I call:

qmake -spec macx-g++ canelib.pro

Which produces a Makefile, and then simply:

make

Which produces an app. qmake is part of qt and is included with the QT SDK
installation (Andrew: I think).
