Things to implement. From Erik (27/10/15).
When implemented, mention in SVN commit and remove from this list.

Rotation within pattern -- I'm thinking ctrl-click on box handle.
Delete/backspace key on keyboard should delete the currently selected thing
(e.g. subcane in customize) instead of the currently selected cane.
Select all (ctrl/apple A) in Customize.
Rectangular select (two types, like Rhino/most CAD).
Snap to x=0 or y=0 (center of overall cane)
Ctrl D and other shortcuts for duplicate, etc. buttons at bottom
All horizontal layout as one of the builtin pickup patterns
Ability to add column of cane for organization (e.g. to keep simple cane separate from complex cane).
Arrow keys to move subcanes around in customize cane.
Square grid layout (in cane) should go up to at least 64
Rectangles, just supporting pure color, not canes (called 'ribbons')

Harder ones:

Flip or shift/rotate cane in customize pickup
Circular snap: fit circle to centers of selected cane and snap them to that circle, maybe uniformly space Linear snap
Weird shapes of pure color, not cane (via SVG import, or click a polygon,
or something)
Grinding cane down (trimming to bounding circle, optionally)
