***** Revision r1153 *****

-Several command-line options have been added beyond the existing -fullscreen: -randomcomplexpiece and -randomcomplexcane start things off with random examples (as in the Examples menu); -autosave <dir> automatically saves every 10 seconds to the specified directory; -file <file> opens the specified file; -cc <email> adds additional carbon copies to emails generated from the Email button; -museum turns on touchscreen "museum" mode (warning: does not prompt you to save, and closes on idle).

-Random complex examples now have random twist.
