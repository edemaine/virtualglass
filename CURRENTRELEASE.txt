***** Revision r1158 *****

-Remove requirement for -file on command line, so VirtualGlass.exe can now directly take any filenames (not starting with -) on the command line. In particular, this lets VirtualGlass register to open .glass files when double clicking on Windows (after selecting it with Open With).

***** Revision r1156 *****

-Add -nogpu (and -gpu) command-line options, to set initial state of GPU transparency menu option.

***** Revision r1153 *****

-Several command-line options have been added beyond the existing -fullscreen: -randomcomplexpiece and -randomcomplexcane start things off with random examples (as in the Examples menu); -autosave <dir> automatically saves every 10 seconds to the specified directory; -file <file> opens the specified file; -cc <email> adds additional carbon copies to emails generated from the Email button; -museum turns on touchscreen "museum" mode (warning: does not prompt you to save).

-Random complex examples now have random twist.

***** Revision r1132 *****

-Several keyboard bindings have been added to manipulating custom cane layouts and piece shapes. For instance, delete now deletes the current selection.

-Various bug fixes.
