***** Revision r1061 *****

-Undo/redo functionality has been added! This functionality saves all your changes to every color, cane, and piece, so mistakes can be easily undone and exploration of new designs is risk-free.

-The toolbar has been removed. Copying and deletion of colors, canes, and pieces can now be performed by clicking on a library object's "+" and "-". File operations such as "New File", "Open File", and "Save File" have been relegated to the File Menu.

-Various bug fixes.
