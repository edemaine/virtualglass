***** Revision r732 *****

-Fill rules have been reimplemented with a simple interface: drag and drop to fill one subcane, hold shift while dragging to fill all.

-Overlay and underlay colors in the pickup editor are now only displayed within the visualization: drag a color object onto the pickup to color the underlay, hold shift while dragging to color the casing. 

-Resizing of subcanes in the cane editor is now done via a visible innermost casing that can be dragged and filled like any other casing. The resizing also works with custom cane layouts.

-Various bug fixes in the custom cane editor and casing/underlay colors in the pickup editor.
